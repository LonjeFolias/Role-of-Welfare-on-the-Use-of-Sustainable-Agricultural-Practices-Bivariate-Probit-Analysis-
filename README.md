# Role-of-Welfare-on-the-Use-of-Sustainable-Agricultural-Practices-Bivariate-Probit-Analysis-

This repository contains the full analytical workflow for an empirical study examining the role of household welfare in the adoption of Sustainable Agricultural Practices (SAPs) using a bivariate probit (biprobit) model. The study is motivated by the recognition that welfare status and technology adoption decisions are often jointly determined, and that ignoring this interdependence may lead to biased estimates.

The core objective of the analysis is to assess whether household welfare—measured through income, consumption expenditure, or a composite welfare index—influences farmers’ likelihood of adopting SAPs, while explicitly accounting for correlated unobserved factors that simultaneously affect welfare and adoption decisions. The bivariate probit framework is employed to jointly model (i) welfare status and (ii) SAP adoption, allowing the error terms of the two equations to be correlated. This approach addresses potential endogeneity and selection bias that arise when welfare is both a determinant and an outcome of agricultural technology use.

The repository includes:
  1. Cleaned and anonymized datasets used for estimation
  2. Well-documented Stata do-files for data preparation, variable construction, and estimation
  3. Bivariate probit model specifications, diagnostics, and marginal effects



Key covariates include household demographics, asset ownership, access to extension services, market access, agro-ecological characteristics, and institutional factors. The analysis places particular emphasis on interpreting marginal effects and the correlation coefficient (ρ) to understand the extent of unobserved linkage between welfare and SAP adoption.

Overall, this repository is intended to support reproducible research, inform policy discussions on inclusive agricultural transformation, and provide a practical reference for researchers applying bivariate probit models in development and agricultural economics.
